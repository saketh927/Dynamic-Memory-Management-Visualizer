# ðŸ“‚ Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer  

## ðŸ”¹ Description  
The **Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer** is an interactive tool designed to simulate and visualize memory management techniques such as **Paging, Segmentation, and Virtual Memory**. Built using Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib, this application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to demonstrate various memory allocation and page replacement algorithms like **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LRU (Least Recently Used)**. The tool helps users understand memory allocation strategies through real-time graphical representations.
